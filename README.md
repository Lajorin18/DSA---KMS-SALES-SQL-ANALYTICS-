**KMS Sales Analysis â€” SQL Case Study**
**Project Description**
This project analyzes sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency for the fictional KMS dataset using T-SQL.
The dataset covers orders from 2009â€“2012, including product categories, sales figures, shipping methods, and customer segments.
The analysis focuses on identifying the top-performing products, most valuable customers, cost-effective shipping modes, and areas for business improvement.

**ðŸ›  Tools Used**
1. Microsoft SQL Server â€” database management and query execution
2. T-SQL â€” for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis
3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
4. Window Functions (RANK())
5. Aggregate Functions (SUM, ROUND)
6. Joins & Filtering (WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)

**Project Objectives**
- Identify the highest-selling product category.
- Find the top 3 and bottom 3 regions by sales.
- Calculate total sales for specific products in certain regions.
- Determine the bottom 10 customers and suggest strategies for improvement.
- Identify the most expensive shipping method.
- Find top 10 valuable customers and their purchased categories.
- Identify the small business and corporate customers with the highest orders/sales.
- Compare shipping cost vs. profit to optimize logistics.

**Key Insights**
- Technology and Office Supplies led sales, but certain regions underperformed.
- Top 3 regions contributed disproportionately to total sales â€” high ROI zones for marketing focus.
- Express Air had the highest shipping cost but also yielded the highest profit margin.
- The bottom 10 customers could be re-engaged through loyalty offers or feedback surveys.
- Some provinces, like Ontario, showed strong niche demand (e.g., appliances).
